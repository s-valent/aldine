# Changelog

All notable changes to Aldine are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
[SemVer](https://semver.org/) (pre-1.0: minor bumps may break things).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `ALDINE_TEXLIVE_SCHEME=full` build option: compiler image with **all of
  CTAN** preinstalled (scheme-full, ~9 GB on disk) instead of the curated medium set.
  Missing-package compile errors now name the package and point at the option.

### Changed
- Relicensed from MIT to AGPL-3.0 (pre-launch, sole-author): self-hosting is
  unaffected; hosted derivatives must share their modifications. Plugins are
  separate works and may use any license.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-19

First public release. Everything below is new.

### Editor & compile
- CodeMirror 6 LaTeX editor with auto-typeset on idle, live word count,
  command palette (⌘K), light/dark themes.
- TeX Live + latexmk compile service with persistent incremental builds
  (~2 s warm recompiles), sandboxed: no network egress, dropped capabilities,
  CPU/memory/PID limits, restricted shell-escape, compile timeouts.
- Error panel with plain-English hints, line numbers, click-to-jump, raw log.
- SyncTeX both ways: double-click the PDF to jump to source, ⌘J to jump the
  PDF to the cursor.
- Drag-drop figure upload, PDF zoom.

### Collaboration & versioning
- Real-time collaboration via Yjs CRDTs (embedded Hocuspocus): multi-cursor,
  live presence, conflict-free merges, unlimited collaborators.
- Every project is a real git repository; branches are git worktrees and are
  editable concurrently. Auto-checkpoints while writing, named checkpoints,
  history view with diffs, one-click revert.
- Review mode: anchored threaded comments on text selections, optional
  suggested replacements the author accepts with one click.

### Integrations
- GitHub sync: import a repo as a project, push/pull with ahead/behind
  indicators, conflict resolution, opt-in auto-sync, branch switching, open a
  PR from the editor. OAuth or personal access token.
- Zotero: link a library or a single collection, version-aware `.bib` refresh,
  citation search panel, `\cite{` autocomplete.
- Cite by DOI / arXiv identifier — BibTeX appended, `\cite` inserted.
- AI error fix (optional, BYO key via OpenRouter or Anthropic): plain-English
  diagnosis of failed typesets with one-click fixes. Key stays server-side.
- Plugin system: manifest + ES-module plugins extend sidebar, editor, and
  commands. Zotero, references, and AI-fix ship as plugins.

### Self-hosting & operations
- Two-container `docker compose up` deploy; flat-file storage by default,
  zero external services required.
- Optional multi-user auth (`AUTH_ENABLED=1`): per-project ownership and
  sharing, Google & GitHub SSO, email/password (scrypt, revocable HTTP-only
  cookie sessions), SSO-only mode, password reset via SES/SMTP.
- Scale-out path: Postgres (`DATABASE_URL`) + Redis (`REDIS_URL`) for
  multi-node; see docs/SCALING.md.
- TLS profile (Caddy auto-certificates), backup/restore scripts + systemd
  timer, Terraform for a full serverless-ish AWS deployment (deploy/aws).
- Templates: article, IAC conference paper, beamer, report/thesis.
